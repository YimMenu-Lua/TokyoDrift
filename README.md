## Features:

#### Drift:
 - Activate one of the two options then hold left shift to drift. Credits to [Harmless](https://github.com/harmless05).

#### Launch Control:
 - When your car is completely stopped, press and hold **Accelerate** + **Brake** together for 3 seconds then let go of the brake button.

> [!NOTE]
> While this option is active, you will not be able to do a burnout.

#### NOS:
 - This option does not magically push your car forward at a ridiculous speed, instead it tries to simulate nitrous by increasing your vehicle's torque and top speed. When this option is activated, another checkbox will appear allowing you to enable/disable boost screen effects (Disabled by default).

#### NOS Purge:
 - Press vehicle duck button ( **[X]** on keyboard, **[A]** on controller ) to purge your nos just like in 2Fast 2Furious. A nitrous purge [looks like this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ff/7c/d1/ff7cd16c359103e7628049baf770c57e.jpg).

#### Big Subwoofer:
 - Simply makes your vehicle's radio sound louder from the outside. You will only notice a difference when you stand next to your car while the radio is on.

#### Pops & Bangs:
 - Adds a crackle tune to your vehicle. Whenever you let go of the accelerator at high RPM, your exhaust will start backfiring and popping, [similar to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn7rdsFjtok).
   
   When this option is enabled, another checkbox will appear allowing you to make your pops sound much louder (like gunshots). [**In-game example**](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75b99421-bc4c-4907-998b-ede9279f3196).



#### High Beams On Horn:
 - Flash your high beams whenever you use your horn.

#### Auto Brake Lights:
 - Automatically turns on your vehicle's brake lights when you come to a complete stop.

#### Keep Engine On:
 - This option is not the same as the one in YimMenu. This one brings back GTA 4's vehicle exit style: Hold **[F]** to turn off the engine before you exit your vehicle or press the button normally to exit and keep the engine running.

#### Can't Touch This!:
 - Prevent NPCs and players from carjacking you.

#### RGB Headlights:
 - Starts an RGB loop on your headlights.

#### Change Engine Sound:
 - Only works on land vehicles: This opens a new window providing you with a list of all vehicles, choose one and press the button to use that model's sound. (This is only local, other players will still hear the default vehicle sound).

#### Destroy/Fix Engine:
 This button switches labels and functionalities depending on your vehicle's engine health:
 - If your engine health is full and you want to destroy it for some reason, you can use this button to do so.
 - If your engine health is below max or completely destroyed, you can use this button to fix it as long as it doesn't have water damage.
